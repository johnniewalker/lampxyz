=======

A demonstation project that uses Linux, Apache, Mysql, Php, Xandria, Yalla and Zend technologies.

This demo is to be used as a cheat-sheet for new projects.

Note: Xandria and Yalla are two projects under incubation under my GitHub account. So, there is not much info about them out there just yet. Browse the projects at https://github.com/johnniewalker for more information.

### Planned Project Directory Structure

This is the plan for the project structure. Check against actual directory to see if the structure came out according to plan.

```
/
 docs/
  requirements.org  
  non-user-documentation.org 
  user-documentation.org
  
```

* docs/
  
 Docs have the .org suffix to enable easy writing in orgmode for emacs. A tool which, apparently makes hierarchical data easier to edit.
 
* requirements.org  
 
 A note to explain the requirements change process and how requirements are stored. I base the system on the ideas found in Steve McConnell's book 'Software Project Survival Guide'.
 
* non-user-documentation.org 

 Any requirements that cannot be classed as User Documentation go in this orgmode document. For this project the definition of a 'User' is very broad.

* user-documentation.org

 All other requirements go in this orgmode document in the form of User Documentation.
